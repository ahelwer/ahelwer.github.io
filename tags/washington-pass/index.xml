Hiked the Persis/Index traverse. Main takeaways:
Road is closed for logging 6 miles from the Persis trailhead; consider using a sturdy mountain bike on the approach. Route is completely snow-free in late season, traction/ice axe/heavy boots unnecessary (early season has steep snowfield above 2000 ft cliff). Huge amounts of blueberries mean black bears in area, bring appropriate food storage systems if staying overnight. Consider bringing a lightweight 30m rope as a handline for going up/down one section of steep loose dirt.</description></item></channel></rss>
