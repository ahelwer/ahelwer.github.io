Camped up on Heliotrope Ridge for two nights as part of a three-day ice skills class. Hike in wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. The big river crossing is doable; recommend trekking poles and a pair of lightweight sandals to change into. Just focus your eyes on a fixed point (not the moving water!) and methodically place your feet as you move across the river. There are a couple of other minor river crossings which are doable with rock-hopping, but very difficult to avoid getting your feet wet so bring appropriate footwear.</description></item><item><title>Trip Report: Hidden Lake Lookout</title><link>https://outdoors.ahelwer.ca/post/2017-07-24-hidden-lake-lookout/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://outdoors.ahelwer.ca/post/2017-07-24-hidden-lake-lookout/</guid><description>Republished from the WTA website here.
Summary A very rough road leads to the trailhead. No parking or camping permits required. There is a long middle section with switchbacks through thorny plants without any shade. Water sources are plentiful. Horseflies were annoying. Many flat sites are available for camping, but beware one in an active rockfall area. Snow is easily traversible without microspikes or even trekking poles. There is only one latrine on the entire mountain, which is only easily accessible from the lookout.</description></item></channel></rss>
